Description: Provides tools to import, preprocess, analyze, and cluster gene expression 
    data from bulk RNA-seq. The package supports input from CSV, TSV and TXT, applies 
    standard normalization techniques, detects outlier genes, performs clustering using 
    various algorithms (e.g., hierarchical clustering, k-means),and generates 
    visualizations such as PCA plots, heatmaps, and dendrograms. Includes functionality 
    for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on gene clusters.
