\title{Plot GSEA Results Dotplot for Two Clusters Using a Combined Ranking}
\usage{
plot_gsea(gsea_result, top_n = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsea_result}{An object of class gseaResult returned by gsea_enrichment.}

\item{top_n}{Integer indicating how many top pathways to display per cluster
based on NES magnitude. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A plot displaying the dotplot of enriched pathways for both clusters.
}
\description{
This function visualizes Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results obtained
from a combined gene ranking of two clusters. It shows enriched pathways
with positive NES (cluster 1) and negative NES (cluster 2) in a single dotplot.
}
\details{
Top pathways are selected by NES, regardless of statistical significance.
Significant terms (adjusted p < 0.05) are highlighted with stronger opacity.
