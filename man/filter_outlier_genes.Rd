\title{Filter Outlier Genes Based on Expression and Variance Metrics}
\usage{
filter_outlier_genes(
  data,
  min_mean_expr = 1,
  min_var = 0.5,
  z_cutoff = 3,
  plot_report = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix or data frame of gene expression values. Rows correspond to genes and columns to samples.
It is expected that data is normalized (e.g., log-transformed).}

\item{min_mean_expr}{Numeric scalar. Minimum mean expression threshold. Genes with mean expression below this are removed. Default is 1.}

\item{min_var}{Numeric scalar. Minimum variance threshold. Genes with variance below this are removed. Default is 0.5.}

\item{z_cutoff}{Numeric scalar. Z-score cutoff for detecting outliers in mean expression and variance. Genes with Z-scores outside Â±z_cutoff are removed. Default is 3.}

\item{plot_report}{Logical. If TRUE, diagnostic histograms of mean expression, variance, and their Z-scores are plotted. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A filtered gene expression matrix containing only genes passing all filtering criteria.
}
\description{
This function performs exploratory filtering of genes in a gene expression matrix to remove potential outliers.
It filters genes based on minimum mean expression, minimum variance, and extreme Z-score values of mean and variance.
Optional diagnostic plots visualize the distributions before filtering.

# Assuming `normalized` is your normalized gene expression matrix
