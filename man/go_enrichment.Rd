\title{Perform GO Enrichment Analysis for Gene Clusters}
\usage{
go_enrichment(gene_clusters, organism_db)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_clusters}{Named vector or factor indicating cluster assignment for each gene.
The names should be gene identifiers (e.g., gene symbols or Ensembl IDs).}

\item{organism_db}{AnnotationDbi organism database object to map gene IDs and perform enrichment.
Default is org.Hs.eg.db (human).}

\item{ontology}{Character string specifying which GO ontology to use.
Options are "BP" (Biological Process), "MF" (Molecular Function), or "CC" (Cellular Component).
Default is "BP".}

\item{keyType}{Character string specifying the type of gene IDs used in gene_clusters.
Common options include "SYMBOL" and "ENSEMBL". Default is "SYMBOL".}
}
\value{
A named list of enrichResult objects, one per cluster.
        Clusters with fewer than 10 mapped genes are skipped with a message.
}
\description{
This function performs Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on sets of genes grouped by clusters.
It uses the clusterProfiler package to identify enriched GO terms within each cluster. The function
returns one list for each cluster.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose kmeans$clusters is a named vector with gene cluster assignments
go_kemeans <- go_enrichment(kmeans$clusters)
# Access GO enrichment for cluster "1"
go_kmeans[["1"]]
}
}
