\title{Compute log2 Fold Change for Genes in Each Cluster}
\usage{
compute_log2fc(expr, clusters)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{A numeric matrix or data frame of normalized expression data
(genes × samples). Rows are genes, columns are samples.}

\item{clusters}{A named or unnamed vector indicating the cluster assignment
of each sample (length equal to number of columns in `expr`).}
}
\value{
A matrix of log2 fold changes (genes × clusters).
        Each value is computed as log2(mean in cluster / mean in other clusters),
        with a small pseudocount added to avoid log of zero.
}
\description{
This function computes the log2 fold change (log2FC) of gene expression
for each gene between samples within a cluster and all other samples.
}
\details{
It returns a matrix where each column corresponds to a cluster and each row
to a gene, with values representing the log2 fold change of expression in that
cluster versus the rest.

\examples{
\dontrun{
kmeans <- clustering(expr, k = 10, method = "kmeans")
log2fc <- compute_log2fc(expr, kmeans$clusters)
}
